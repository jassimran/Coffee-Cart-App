# Coffee-Cart-App
An Android App for a Coffee Shop

Brad and Janet, the owners of the local Atlanta coffee shop LameDucks, plan to install a number of coffee carts in various local spots and want to put in place a reward system based on VIP cards on which customers can accrue points based on the amount of money they spend and get benefits based on their points. Brad and Janet want the coffee cartsâ€™ managers to be able to manage the reward system on their Android devices, so they want to develop a coffee cart rewards management software system for Android. Because Brad and Janet studied computer science in college and were fascinated by UML, they want to follow the Unified Software Process for this application.
